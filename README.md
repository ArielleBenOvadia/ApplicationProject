Welcom to Arielle's Horizon!

Arielle's Horizon is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and conservation of oceans and sea turtles.
Founded in 2023, our organization is driven by a passionate group of individuals,
committed to creating a sustainable future for these majestic marine creatures and the fragile ecosystems they inhabit.

Our mission is twofold: 
to raise awareness about the critical importance of ocean conservation and to actively work towards protecting sea turtles, whose populations are rapidly declining.
We believe that by safeguarding sea turtles and their habitats, we can also contribute to the overall health and well-being of our oceans.

At Arielle's Horizon, we strive to educate individuals of all ages about the various environmental challenges our oceans face.
We organize workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, aiming to inspire a sense of responsibility and promote environmentally conscious behaviors.
Through these initiatives, we hope to foster a deep appreciation for the vital role oceans play in sustaining life on Earth.

Our organization actively engages in fieldwork and conservation efforts to protect sea turtles.
We collaborate with local communities, researchers, and conservationists to implement initiatives that ensure the survival and thriving of these endangered creatures.
This includes monitoring nesting sites, conducting research on sea turtle behavior and migration patterns, rescuing and rehabilitating injured turtles,
and advocating for stronger legal protections.

Arielle's Horizon also plays a crucial role in policy advocacy and lobbying for stricter regulations to combat pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction.
We actively partner with, non-profit organizations and other stakeholders to enact meaningful change at a broader level.

In addition to our conservation work, we have a unique approach to fundraising. All the income generated from the products we sell goes directly to our non-profit organization to support our initiatives to save and clean the oceans.
By purchasing our merchandise, you not only receive high-quality products but also contribute directly to our conservation efforts.

We rely on the generous support of individuals, businesses, and grants to fund our programs and initiatives.
Through donations, sponsorships, and volunteer contributions, we can expand our reach and make a tangible impact on ocean conservation and the survival of sea turtles.

By joining Arielle's Horizon, you become part of a dedicated community united in the common goal of safeguarding our oceans and protecting the future of sea turtles. Together, we can create a brighter horizon for these magnificent creatures, ensuring their continued existence for generations to come.
